        <h3>
          Why isn&apos;t &lt;INSERT FAVORITE DISTRO&gt; promoted on the website?
        </h3>

        <p className="p4">
          The End Of 10 website and outreach are intentionally distro-agnostic.
          The goal is to speak as a big FOSS family. We want the campaign and
          activities to represent all of our communities.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Does distro-agnostic mean FOSS communities cannot promote their own
          work?
        </h3>

        <p className="p4">
          Individual FOSS communities are welcome to promote their own work in
          the context of the campaign, with two caveats: (i) it must be clear
          you are speaking for your community and not the campaign, and (ii) you
          must not speak negatively about the work of other communities.
        </p>

        <p className="p4">
          For example, one of the planned activities is a &ldquo;Lists of
          10&ldquo; social media campaign with the hashtag #EndOf10. In this
          context:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The official End Of 10 social media account remains as neutral as
            possible (e.g., &ldquo;10 reasons to switch to Linux&ldquo;) and
            does not promote any specific distro.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your community does outreach on social media with a &ldquo;10
            reasons to switch to &lt;YOUR PROJECT&gt;&ldquo; with the #EndOf10
            hashtag. In the list of reasons you promote your own work. However,
            it would be unacceptable to speak negatively about any other FOSS
            community&apos;s work.
